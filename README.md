Primordial Particle Systems:

A computer simulation in which a number of particles on an n-dimensional coordinate system all obey one independently determined motion law. These particle systems tend to arrange themselves into structures, sometimes those structures being self-reproducing patterns, which could be considered life. This is called emergence. Emergence is a fascinating concept which can teach us so many things about life, nothing vs. something and the concept of consciousness. Primordial particle systems can help us understand much more about emergence, and give us some more clues on how emergence helped conciousness appear in our universe. This is a project which demosntrates the emergence of life within a chaotic particle system.
